# **How to implement automatic token insertion in requests using HTTP interceptor**

The mechanism of HTTP interceptor was introduced in Angular version 4.3 as a part of [HTTPClientModule](https://www.tektutorialshub.com/angular/angular-httpclient/). The main purpose of the interceptor to capture and modify HTTP requests and responses.The interceptor can help with a variety of tasks: using in authorization processes by adding a token for the request, changing headers, modifying response from server, retrying failed requests, caching and many other common tasks. [This article](https://indepth.dev/posts/1051/top-10-ways-to-use-interceptors-in-angular) will give you a pretty good overview of the most common cases where interceptors are used.

An interceptor sits between your application code and Angular’s HTTP backend that sends AJAX requests to a server. The following diagram demonstrates this:

You can learn more about internal implementation of interceptors in [Insider’s guide into interceptors and HttpClient mechanics in Angular](https://indepth.dev/posts/1118/insiders-guide-into-interceptors-and-httpclient-mechanics-in-angular). 

Authentication is one of the most common use cases for using an interceptor. In this guide I’ll show you how to implement an interceptor to handle tokens in the authentication process. 

Suppose, we have the following service used in authentication that stores and reads tokens from localstorage:

```javascript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
@Injectable()
export class AuthService{

 constructor() { }

 getAuthToken():string {
 return localeStarage.getItem('token')
 }
}
```

In Angular an interceptor has a form of TS class that implements `HttpInterceptor` interface. 

According to Angular documentation `HttpInterceptor` interface has one crucial method - intercept - that identifies and handles a HTTP request.

```javascript
interface HttpInterceptor {
 intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>>
}
```

- `req` - the outgoing request object to handle.
- `next` - the next interceptor in the chain, or the backend if no interceptors remain in the chain.
- `Observable` - the intercept method returns `Observable<HttpEvent<any>>`. An observable of the event stream. You can handle this Observable due to your future functionality of your application.

Let’s create an `AuthInterceptorService` and add authorization headers:

```javascript
export class AuthInterceptorService implements HttpInterceptor {
  constructor(private authService: AuthService) {} 
 intercept(request: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {  
    const token = this.authService.getAuthToken();

   if (token) {
     // If we have a token, we set it to the header
     request = request.clone({
        setHeaders: {Authorization: `Authorization token ${token}`}
     });
  }

  return next.handle(request).pipe(
  	catchError((err) => {
   	 if (err instanceof HttpErrorResponse) {
       	 if (err.status === 401) {
       	 // redirect user to the logout page
     	}
 	 }
  	return throwError(err);
	})
   )
  }
}
```

As you can see the intercept method is responsible for modifying the `HttpRequest` object. So, we take our token from `authService`. If we do not have any token, we set the header for our request.

Note that `HttpRequest` is an immutable object, so we can not modify it directly. Immutability of `HttpRequests`  in Angular gives certain guarantees best described in [this article](https://indepth.dev/posts/1381/immutability-importance-in-angular-applications) . The clone method of `HttpRequest` allows us to modify the specific properties of the request not modifying it but coping. 

After modifying `HttpRequest` we call the handle method on `HttpHandler` with the `HttpRequest` object (which was successfully cloned). For handling errors we are using the `catchError` operator from RxJS. You can read about this operator in the [reference](https://indepth.dev/reference/rxjs/operators/catch-error). Do not forget to return an observable - `throwError(err)` from the `catchError` function. So, after verifying the error instance we can implement some additional logic - check the status of the error and redirect the user to the logout logout page.

 In our case, the handle method sends the request to the backend server or in another case it could invoke the next interceptor.

 The last bit that’s left is to add `AuthInterceptorService` and `AuthInterceptorService` to the `AppModule`.

```javascript
import {HTTP_INTERCEPTORS } from '@angular/common/http';
import { AuthInterceptorService} from '...';
import { AuthService} from '...';
@NgModule({
 ...
 imports: [
  HttpClientModule,
  ...
 ],
 providers: [
   AuthService , 
  {
   provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
   useClass: AuthInterceptorService,
   multi: true
  },
  ...
 ],
 ...
})

export class AppModule { }
```

In case if you are going to use multiple interceptors you should define them in the next way:

```javascript
import {HTTP_INTERCEPTORS } from '@angular/common/http';
@NgModule({
 ...
 imports: [
  HttpClientModule,
  ...
 ],
 providers: [
   FruitService, 
  {
   provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
   useClass: FirstInterceptor,
   multi: true
  },
  {
   provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
   useClass: SecondInterceptor,
   multi: true
  },
  ...
 ],
 ...
})

export class AppModule { }
```

It is important to mention that interceptors will be called in the order in which they were provided. When you set optional attribute `multi` as `true`, it tells Angular that the provider is a multi provider - we can provide multiple values for a single token in DI. The bunch of interceptors can also create a chain which is related to each other. How to implement a custom middleware chain you can read [here](https://indepth.dev/posts/1118/insiders-guide-into-interceptors-and-httpclient-mechanics-in-angular#constructing-observable-stream-of-handlers-chain).

## **Summary:**

The `HttpInterceptor` in Angular is a very useful mechanism that provides valuable functionality - managing request or response. In the intercept method you can use immutable principles for changing request or response. 

Handling your request/response can solve a lot of problems such as error handling, authentification, adding custom headers to the outgoing request, logging the incoming response, etc.
